# Triangle-Side-Sum-Checker
Project Overview
This project is a basic C++ program that checks if the sum of two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the third side.
It is a simple implementation that asks for the lengths of three sides and evaluates whether the sum of any two sides meets the conditions of a valid triangle.
## Features
Side Input: Users are prompted to input the lengths of three sides.
Sum Check: The program calculates the sum of two sides and checks if it is greater than or equal to the third side.
Boolean Output: The result of the check is displayed as either 1 (true) or 0 (false).
How It Works
Input:

The user is prompted to input the lengths of three sides: Side A, Side B, and Side C.
Sum Calculation:

The program checks whether the sum of Side A and Side B is greater than or equal to Side C. This check is stored in a boolean variable sum.
Output:

The program prints the result of the check, indicating whether the sum of two sides is greater than or equal to the third side.
## Code Analysis
Variables
SideA, SideB, SideC: Used to store the lengths of the three sides entered by the user.
sum: A boolean variable that stores the result of the sum condition check.
## Logic Flow
The lengths of the three sides are input by the user.
The program calculates if the sum of Side A and Side B is greater than or equal to Side C and stores the result in the sum variable.
The result is then displayed to the user, showing whether the condition is satisfied.

## Requirements
A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC).

This project provides a basic understanding of how to work with triangle side lengths and checks their sum using simple C++ logic.
